# pingpong-turtle-python

This is a pingpong multiplayer game in which I have used sockets for communication between the two players and the server the two players when connected to the same network can play against each other and the scores of the match are stored in the database.
To play this game first of all you have to run the server using the command python server.py and the two clients using the python command. The winner of the game is declared when a player scores 7 points.
